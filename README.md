# Magic Ball Game

#### In this simple ReactJS application, I built a simulation of the classic kid's toy the magic Eight Ball. 

#### The initial reading on the ball is "Think of a Question and the inital ball color is black. 

##### The Eight Ball takes a simple property called answer, which takes an array of objects {msg, color}.

#### The Eight Ball keeps track of the color and message. The color and message changes as the ball is clicked, or if the reset button is clicked it will reset the ball back to the initial color and message.
